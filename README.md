    - Complete the form 
    - Open the correct URL for the microservice that you created the superuser


- When changing models, make and run migrations:
  - Run docker exec -it «api-container-name» bash to connect to the running service that contains your API service.

### Inventory API (Optional)

 - Put Inventory API documentation here. This is optional if you have time, otherwise prioritize the other services.
​
### Service API
 - Put Service API documentation here
​
### Sales API
**TODO: EDIT HERE**


On the backend, the sales microservice has 4 models: AutomobileVO, Customer, SalesPerson, and SalesRecord. SalesRecord is the model that interacts with the other three models. This model gets data from the three other models.

The AutomobileVO is a value object that gets data about the automobiles in the inventory using a poller. The sales poller automotically polls the inventory microservice for data, so the sales microservice is constantly getting the updated data.

The reason for integration between these two microservices is that when recording a new sale, you'll need to choose which car is being sold and that information lives inside of the inventory microservice.
